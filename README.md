# Student Result Manager (CLI)

## Overview
This is a **Command-Line Interface (CLI) Python project** that allows users to manage student records efficiently. The program lets you add students, record their grades, view individual student results, and view all students at once.  

It is designed as a simple, interactive terminal application, ideal for learning Python basics such as **functions, dictionaries, loops, and user input**.

## Features
- **Add Student:** Enter a student ID and name to store a new student.  
- **Add Grade:** Assign a grade for a specific subject to an existing student.  
- **View Student:** Display the name and grades of a particular student.  
- **View All Students:** List all registered students.  
- **Exit:** Quit the program safely.  

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository or download `main.py`.  
2. Open it in a Python environment that supports `input()` and `print()` (e.g., Pyto, Carnets, or any desktop Python IDE).  
3. Run the script:  
   ```bash
   python main.py
